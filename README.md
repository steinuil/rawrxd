# Licensing

## UnRAR EULA disclaimer

This library is based on the UnRAR source code distributed at https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm

The license of the UnRAR source code states that the code may **not** be used to reverse engineer the RAR compression algorithm and develop a RAR compatible archiver. This applies to this library too, which is derived from the UnRAR source code.

> Unrar source may be used in any software to handle RAR archives
> without limitations free of charge, but cannot be used to re-create
> the RAR compression algorithm, which is proprietary. Distribution
> of modified Unrar source in separate form or as a part of other
> software is permitted, provided that it is clearly stated in
> the documentation and source comments that the code may not be used
> to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.

For more details, refer to the UnRAR source code license and the WinRAR EULA.

## Test case license

The test cases have been copied from [junrar](https://github.com/junrar/junrar) and their license
is unknown. If that poses a legal issue they can be deleted.
